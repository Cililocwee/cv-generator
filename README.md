# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Easy to use

This "single-page CV" generator comes with a basic structure already set up. The user simply clicks which text they want to customize and they enter in the data in the opened field.

## Keep it simple

This version of the generator does not come with the ability to add or delete sections or change section headings. The purpose of this choice is to keep things simple. The sections already included are present in most modern CVs. As this is a "single-page CV" generator, the number of positions for experience and education is limited.
